I'm excited to share my latest work on Gemini Clone, a fully responsive web application built using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and integrated with the Google Generative AI. Here's what makes it special:

✨ Responsive Design: Adaptable on all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.

⚛️ React + Tailwind: Leveraged React for component-based architecture and Tailwind CSS for efficient styling.

🔍 Gemini API Integration: Implemented real-time responses from Google Gemini's powerful AI, offering users prompt and insightful results.

This project was not just about coding; it was a great learning experience in managing APIs, optimizing front-end performance, and crafting a UI that’s both functional and elegant. 🚀💻

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
